## Twelve Years of Evidence: Modelling the Injury Severity of Single-Vehicle Collisions pre- and post-20mph Implementation in Edinburgh and Glasgow

## Project Overview

This project models the injury severity of single-vehicle collision pre- and post-20mph implementation in Edinburgh and Glasgow. The analysis was motivated by recent changes to traffic calming policy in both cities. In Edinburgh, a citywide, blanket 20mph speed limit was introduced on all city centre roads from 2016 onwards; converesly, Glasgow expanded its network of 20mph roads, but the approach was less radical than that adopted in Edinburgh. The distinctness of the 20mph approaches in both cities allows intercity comparisions to be made concerning the efficacy of each 20mph approach. In particular, we were interested in the effect that each approach had on pedestrian safety (hence the focus on single-vehicle collisions - the vast majority of these are vehicle-pedestrian collisions in an urban context).
